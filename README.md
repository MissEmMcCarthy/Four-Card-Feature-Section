## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project was great because it helped me to develop my understanding of when to use Grid, Flexbox and positioning. The main card section is structured through grid-template-areas whereas the content inside the columns and the header uses flexbox. I also used position absolute to align the icons inside the cards.

This was the first project I have done so far where I felt like I used CSS selectors appropriately to keep my CSS clean and easy to understand.

### Continued development

I need to keep practising!
